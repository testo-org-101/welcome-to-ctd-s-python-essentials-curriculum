## Lesson Overview

Congrats, you've made it to Lesson 2! This week, we'll deepen our knowledge of core Python concepts, including dictionaries and lists. We'll also learn how to import **modules**, powerful tools that help your Python projects reach their full potential.
Additionally, weâ€™ll learn how to work with the operating system (OS) and virtual environments for more efficient project management.

**Learning objective**: Students will explore various data structures, such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. They will learn how to read and write data to files and use external modules.  Additionally, they will be introduced to basic OS operations and using virtual environments.

Topics:

* Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets: Creating, accessing, and modifying data structures.
* File Handling: Reading from and writing to text and CSV files.
* Introduction to Modules & packages: Importing and using Python libraries.
* Keyboard Input
* Working with the OS: Interacting with the file system and executing commands.
* Virtual Environments: Managing dependencies for Python projects.

## 2.1 Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets

Before we talk about lists and tuples, we need to define two new words: "mutable" and "immutable."

Something that is **mutable** can be modified or changed after it is created. Something that is **immutable** cannot be modified or changed after it is created.

Imagine a piece of clay (mutable) versus a ceramic statue (immutable):

* Clay can be reshaped, squished, or molded into different forms after it's first created. You can add or remove parts easily.
* A ceramic statue, once it's fired in a kiln, cannot be changed without breaking it completely.

In Python programming, here's a concrete example using *mutable* lists and *immutable* tuples:

``` python
# Mutable example (list)
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.append('date')  # We can add a new item
fruits[0] = 'orange'  # We can change an existing item
print(fruits)  # Now ['orange', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']

# Immutable example (tuple)
colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue')
# colors[0] = 'yellow'  # This would cause an error
# You cannot change the tuple after creation
```
Strings are also immutable in Python.  This would cause an error:
```
capital = "raleigh"
capital[0] = "R"
```

### Lists

A **list** is a *mutable*, ordered collection of items. Lists allow duplicates and can hold items of different types, although typically youâ€™ll find lists containing items of the same type. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list, making them versatile for storing data that may change.

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  # Define a list
fruits.append('orange')  # Add an item
print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']
```

#### Key List Methods

* `append(item)`: Adds `item` to the end of the list.
* `remove(item)`: Removes the first occurrence of `item`.
* `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.

There lots of methods and operations which apply to lists including all of the [common](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-common) and [mutable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-mutable) sequence operations.

A list is an example of an iterable.  So you can iterate on it, as follows:

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
There are various other iterable collections in Python, such as tuples.

#### The map() Function for Lists.

The map() function is not a method of the list class.  It is a Python built in function that operates on iterables. Suppose you have a list of numbers, and you want to increment all of them.  You can do it as follows:

```python
list_one = [3,4,5]
def incrementor(x):
    return x + 1

list_two = list(map(incrementor, list_one)) # [4,5,6]
```

You pass the map() function two arguments, the function that changes the list item, and the iterable itself.  The function returns an iterable, and we can do type coversion to create a list.  Now, the incrementor() function above looks a little stupid.  You'd like to pass something in line, and for that, Python provides:

### Lambdas

```python
list_one = [3,4,5]
list_two = list(map(lambda x: x+1, list_one)) # [4,5,6]
```

The lambda feature is a way to declare a simple function.  Lambdas are, in some respects, similar to arrow functions in JavaScript, but they are much more limited.  A lambda is a simple one liner.  The syntax is as follows: the word `lambda` followed by the arguments to be passed (the map function only passes one parameter, so in the case above there is only argument for the lambda), followed by a colon `:`, followed by an expression.  The value of the expression is what is returned by the lambda.  You can only give one expression in a lambda, so there is no room for multiple statements.

### Slicing Lists

You can create a subset list from a list by slicing.  Here are examples:

```python
list_1 = ['A','B','C','D','E']
list_2 = list_1[1:3] # Slicing from beginning to end. Gives ['B','C'].  list_1[3] is not included.
list_3 = list_1[2:]  # Gives ['C','D','E']
list_4 = list_1[:2]  # Gives ['A', 'B']
list_5 = list_1[-2:] # Gives ['D', 'E'] -- the last two elements

### Tuples

A **tuple** is an *immutable*, ordered collection of items. Once defined, the elements in a tuple cannot be modified, added, or removed. Tuples are useful for data that shouldnâ€™t change, like fixed configuration values or coordinates.

```python
dimensions = (1920, 1080)  # Define a tuple
print(dimensions[0])  # Access the first element: Output: 1920
```

#### Why use tuples?

* Tuples are memory-efficient compared to lists.
* Useful when you want a constant, fixed-size collection of data.

### Dictionaries

A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and used to store and retrieve data efficiently. Dictionaries are ideal for mapping relationships, such as a userâ€™s name to their profile data or an item to its price.

```python
person = {'name': 'Jazmine', 'age': 30}  # Define a dictionary
print(person['name'])  # Output: Jazmine
person['email'] = 'jazmine@example.com'  # Add a new key-value pair
```

#### Key Dictionary Methods

* `keys()`: Returns a list of keys in the dictionary.
* `values()`: Returns a list of values.
* `items()`: Returns an iterable over the key, value pairs in the dictionary
* `get(key)`: Returns the value associated with `key`, or `None` if `key` is not found.

The operations and methods available for dictionaries are documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mapping-types-dict).

### Sets

A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for removing duplicates from a list or performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}  # Define a set (duplicates are ignored)
unique_numbers.add(5)  # Add a new item
print(unique_numbers)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```

#### Common Set Operations

* `union()`: Returns a set containing all unique elements from both sets.
* `intersection()`: Returns elements common to both sets.
* `difference()`: Returns elements present in one set but not the other.

Set operations and methods are documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset).

### Review Table: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets

Ok, let's review! Here's a table demonstrating the key differences between the four new terms we just learned:

| Data Structure | Ordered | Changeable (Mutable) | Allows Duplicates | Key-Value Pairs |
|----------------|---------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **List**       | Yes     | Yes                 | Yes               | No              |
| **Tuple**      | Yes     | No                  | Yes               | No              |
| **Dictionary** | No      | Yes (Keys: No)      | Keys: No, Values: Yes | Yes           |
| **Set**        | No      | Yes                 | No                | No              |

**Answer**: C) Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs and do not allow duplicate keys.

</details>

## 2.2 File Handling

In Python, reading from and writing to text files is handled with the `open()` function. Text files are simple, containing plain text data, making them ideal for storing simple logs, configuration data, or notes.

#### Reading a Text File

To read a file, use `open()` with the `"r"` (read) mode and call `.read()`, `.readline()`, or .`readlines()` to get the content.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()  # Read entire file
    print(content)
```

The python above uses the `with` statement.  This is a way to keep your code looking clean.  You always want to close the file when you are done.  The `with` statement closes it for you on exit from the block.  The file is closed even if there is an exception, but the exception is still passed on to you.  Later in the course, you will also use the `with` statement for a database connection, and it serves the same purpose.

File operations, including the open(), can raise exceptions.  To make your code robust, you put them in a try block, as follows:

```python
try:
    with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()  # Read entire file
        print(content)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred reading the file: {e}")
else:
    print("The file was read ok.")
```
If your `with` block is longer, you may have other try blocks inside it for more granular exception handling.

#### Writing to a Text File

To write to a file, open it in `"w"` (write) or `"a"` (append) mode. Writing mode will overwrite the file if it exists, while append mode will add to the file.

```python
with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!")  # Write to the file
```

The `write()` method does not add a newline after the string which is provided.  The special character `'\n'` can be added to the end of the string to add a newline.

#### Additional Modes

* `"r+"`: Read and write
* `"a"`: Append to the file (keeps existing content).

### Reading and Writing CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are commonly used to store tabular data, where each row is a new line, and each value is separated by a comma. Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` module makes it easy to work with these files.

#### Reading a CSV File

To read a CSV file, use `csv.reader()` and iterate through the rows.

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

#### Writing to a CSV File

To write to a CSV file, use `csv.writer()`. Each row should be a list or tuple representing a row in the CSV.

```python
import csv

with open('example.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'City'])  # Write header row
    writer.writerow(['Jazmine', 30, 'New York'])  # Write a data row
```

#### Additional Options

* `csv.DictReader()` and `csv.DictWriter()`: Use dictionaries to work with row data, which can make reading and writing more convenient when you have headers.

### 2.2 Video: Reading and Writing a CSV File

In this video, we'll demonstrate reading and writing to a real CSV file. After the video, practice reading and writing to a CSV file using the W3 Resource tutorial [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/csv/index.php).

**[View the video here](https://youtu.be/MWYRGLKMzAQ?feature=shared).**

### 2.2 Check for Understanding

**Question**: What does the `"w"` mode do when opening a file in Python?

* A) Reads the file without making changes.
* B) Appends new data to the end of the file.
* C) Overwrites the file with new data, creating it if it doesnâ€™t exist.
* D) Opens the file for reading and writing without overwriting.

## 2.3 Introduction to Modules

In Python, modules and packages are essential tools for organizing and reusing code. This section will cover everything you need to know about working with both modules and packages effectively.

### Modules

A module is a Python file containing code (functions, classes, and variables) that can be reused across different parts of a project. Modules help with:

1. **Code Organization**: Breaking large codebases into manageable files
2. **Reusability**: Using common code wherever needed
3. **Namespace Management**: Avoiding naming conflicts
4. **Built-in Functionality**: Accessing Python's standard library features

#### Importing Modules

There are several ways to import modules:

```python
# Import entire module
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0

# Import specific functions
from math import sqrt
print(sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0

# Use aliases for shorter names
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['Jazmine', 'Luis'], 'Age': [30, 35]})
```

#### Creating Custom Modules

You can create your own modules by saving Python code in a .py file:

```python
# math_tools.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# main.py
import math_tools
print(math_tools.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5
```

### Packages

A package is a collection of related modules organized in a directory structure. Packages require an `__init__.py` file to mark the directory as a Python package.  In this course, we don't create large projects with many modules, but as a Python professional, you will need to do this.  The contents of `__init__.py` are not described in this lesson, but you can view [this tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) to see how it is to be done (this is optional for this course).

#### Package Structure Example
```
my_package/
    __init__.py         # Makes this directory a package
    math_tools.py       # Module for math operations
    string_tools.py     # Module for string operations
```

#### Using Packages

```python
# Import specific modules from a package
from my_package import math_tools
print(math_tools.add(10, 20))

# Import specific functions (if configured in __init__.py)
from my_package import add, multiply
```

### Types of Modules

1. **Standard Library**: Provides a vast library of modules and infrastructure.  It is documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). Examples of built-in modules include:
   - `datetime` for dates and times
   - `json` for JSON data
   - `os` for operating system operations

2. **External Libraries**: Additional modules installed via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   
   # Then use in code:
   import requests
   response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
   ```

### 2.3 Check for Understanding

**Question**: Which of the following commands correctly imports only the sqrt function from the `math` module?

* A) `import sqrt from math`
* B) `from math import sqrt`
* C) `import math.sqrt`
* D) `import math as sqrt`

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer**: B) `from math import sqrt`

</details>

## 2.4 Keyboard Input

In Python, handling keyboard input is straightforward, making it easy to interact with users. The input() function is the main way to capture user input from the keyboard, which you can then use directly or store in a variable for further processing.

#### Using `input()`

The `input()` function displays a prompt (optional) and waits for the user to type something and press Enter. By default, `input()` captures the input as a string, so if you need it in another format (like an integer), youâ€™ll have to convert it.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")  # Displays a prompt and waits for input
print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Greets the user with their input
```

#### Converting Input Types

Since `input()` returns data as a string, youâ€™ll often want to convert it for calculations or comparisons.

```python
age = input("Enter your age: ")  # Gets input as a string
age = int(age)  # Converts input to an integer
print(f"Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.")
```

If the user types something that canâ€™t be converted (e.g., entering "twenty" instead of "20"), this will raise an error. To handle this gracefully, you can use `try-except`:

```python
try:
    age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
    print(f"Next year, you will be {age + 1} years old.")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
```

### Example: Simple Calculator Using Keyboard Input

Hereâ€™s a basic example that combines multiple `input()` calls to create a calculator. Pay attention to this code, because you'll be creating a calculator in this week's assignment!

```python
# Simple calculator
try:
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    operation = input("Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): ")

    if operation == "+":
        print("Result:", num1 + num2)
    elif operation == "-":
        print("Result:", num1 - num2)
    elif operation == "*":
        print("Result:", num1 * num2)
    elif operation == "/":
        print("Result:", num1 / num2)
    else:
        print("Invalid operation")
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter valid numbers.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
```

### 2.4 Check for Understanding

**Question**: Which of the following statements about `input()` in Python is correct?

* A) `input()` captures user input and automatically converts it to an integer.
* B) `input()` displays a prompt and captures user input as a string by default.
* C) `input()` captures user input but only works with numbers.
* D) `input()` is used to output text to the console.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

**Answer**: B) input() displays a prompt and captures user input as a string by default.

</details>

## 2.5 Working with the OS

The `os` module in Python provides a powerful interface for interacting with the operating system. It enables you to perform various tasks, including:

* File and directory manipulation
* Environment variable handling
* Running system commands

These functionalities are essential for automating processes and managing files within Python programs.

### Common os Module Functions

**Getting the Current Working Directory**

The `os.getcwd()` function retrieves the path of the current working directory (the directory from which your Python script is executing).

```python
import os
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(f"Current working directory: {current_directory}")
```

**Changing the Current Working Directory**

You can change the current working directory using `os.chdir(path)`, where `path` specifies the directory you want to switch to.

```python
os.chdir('/path/to/your/folder')
print(f"New working directory: {os.getcwd()}")
```

**Listing Files in a Directory**

The `os.listdir()` function returns a list containing all files and folders within the specified directory.

```python
files = os.listdir('/path/to/your/folder')
print(f"Files in the directory: {files}")
```

**Creating and Removing Directories**

Use `os.mkdir()` to create a new directory and `os.rmdir()` to remove an empty directory.

```python
# Create a new directory
os.mkdir('new_folder')

# Remove the directory
os.rmdir('new_folder')
```

*Note: If the directory isn't empty, you'll encounter an error. To remove a non-empty directory, use `shutil.rmtree()` from the `shutil` module.*

**Checking if a Path Exists**

Use `os.path.exists()` to verify if a file or directory exists at the specified path.

```python
if os.path.exists('some_file.txt'):
    print("The file exists.")
else:
    print("The file does not exist.")
```

**Getting File Information**

The `os.path` module provides functions to check file properties. For instance, use `os.path.isfile()` to determine if a path points to a file and `os.path.isdir()` to check if it's a directory.

```python
if os.path.isfile('some_file.txt'):
    print("This is a file.")
elif os.path.isdir('some_folder'):
    print("This is a folder.")
```

**Executing Shell Commands**

The `os.system()` function allows you to execute shell commands from within your Python program. You can leverage this functionality to run system commands like `ls` or `dir` to list files or execute other commands provided by your operating system.

```python
os.system('ls')  # For Linux/Mac
os.system('dir')  # For Windows
```

*Keep in mind that `os.system()` doesn't return the output of the command. If you need the output, consider using `subprocess.run()` instead.*

**Environment Variables**

You can access environment variables using `os.environ`. For example, to retrieve the `PATH` environment variable:

```python
path_variable = os.environ.get('PATH')
print(path_variable)
```

**Addendum: The sys Package**

In many environments, Python is used as a scripting tool.  Python scripts are invoked with arguments.  The user might type:

```bash
python loadfile.py ./current.csv
```
and the script might load the contents of the file into a database.  The sys package enables this (among other things).  Consider the following code:

```python
import sys
for arg in sys.argv:
    print(arg)  # arg[0] is the program name.  The other arguments are what was passed on the command line.
```

The [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse) module provides a powerful framework for handling command line arguments.

## 2.6 Virtual Environments

Virtual environments are a cornerstone of Python development, particularly when managing dependencies and isolating project environments. A virtual environment creates an isolated Python environment, enabling you to have project-specific dependencies that won't interfere with other projects or system-wide Python packages.

### Why Use Virtual Environments?

* **Isolation**: Virtual environments ensure that each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing version conflicts.
* **Reproducibility**: Virtual environments make it simpler to reproduce the exact setup for a project on another machine.
* **Dependency Management**: You can install and update packages without affecting other projects or your system's Python installation.

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Install `virtualenv` (optional)**

   While Python 3.3+ comes with the `venv` module for creating virtual environments, some users prefer using `virtualenv` for additional features. To install it:

   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   You can create a virtual environment using either `venv` (built-in module) or `virtualenv` (third-party package).

   - **Using `venv`**:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv myenv
     ```

     This command creates a directory named `myenv` that contains the virtual environment.  (Note: by convention, `.venv` is usually used as the name of the virtual environment, instead of `myenv` as in this example.)

   - **Using `virtualenv`**:

     ```bash
     virtualenv myenv
     ```

   **In both cases, `myenv` is the directory where the isolated Python environment will live.**

3. **Activating the Virtual Environment**

   To activate the virtual environment, use the following commands:

   * **Windows:**
     The following command assumes that you are using Git Bash as your Windows development terminal environment.  This is strongly recommended.

     ```bash
     source myenv/Scripts/activate
     ```



   * **Mac/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

   Once activated, your terminal prompt will usually change to show the virtual environment's name, e.g., `(myenv)`.

4. **Installing Packages in the Virtual Environment**

   After activation, you can install packages as usual with `pip`. These packages will be installed inside the virtual environment, not globally.

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

   This ensures that the `requests` package is available only in the current virtual environment.

5. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment**

   To exit the virtual environment and return to the global Python environment, simply run:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

6. **Managing Dependencies with `requirements.txt`**

   To record all the dependencies installed in your virtual environment, use the `pip freeze` command to generate a `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

   This file can be used to recreate the environment on another machine:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. **Virtual Environment with IDEs**

   Many IDEs, like VS Code and PyCharm, allow you to configure the Python interpreter to use the virtual environment. This ensures that the IDE uses the correct Python environment with all the necessary packages installed.

### Video 2.6: The Virtual Environment

Check out Video 2.6 for a quick overview of setting up a virtual environment for Python in VS Code.  Note that you have already done this!  Your python_homework directory uses a virtual environment.
