# Template for Pre-Work Lesson Content

This page contains a template and set of best practices for designing learning content. 

## Best Practices

### Overview and Learning Objectives

Each lesson should start with a **learning objective**. This is a statement that shares what students should be able to *do* by the end of a lesson. 
  * Here's an example: "Students will learn how to store scraped data in various formats and retrieve it using SQL and Pandas."
  * Learning objectives can be followed up by a list of **topics** covered in the lesson.

In this course, topics are divided into **subsections.** 

### Subsection Content

Content should be concise, clear, and directly expand student knowledge. When possible, give examples, like this example of how to declare a varable: 

```python
name = "Jazmine"   # A variable storing a string
age = 28           # A variable storing an integer
height = 5.8       # A variable storing a float (decimal)
```

Feel free to include **Check for Understanding Questions ("CFUs")** when helpful. These are short questions that review what students just learned. Here's an example from our Lesson 1: 

**Question:** What type of data is stored in the variable `age` in the following code?

```python
age = 28
```

  * A) String
  * B) Integer
  * C) Float
  * D) Boolean

**Answer**: B) Integer
