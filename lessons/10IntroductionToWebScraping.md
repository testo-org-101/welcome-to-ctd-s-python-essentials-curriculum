**Why Do Web Scraping?**

There is a lot of information on the Internet, as you know, but it is in web pages that are provided so that humans can read them.  If you want to automate the process of searching or archiving some of this information, you need to extract it into a structured format and store it separately, so that you can then do SQL searches or the like on what you save.

Here are some examples:

- Finding the prices of airline flights to a given destination for multiple airlines.
- Finding all scholarly articles on a particular topic you want to research and saving this information for reference.
- Finding the schedule of public meetings for local government bodies.

## **9.1 Basics of HTML and DOM**

### **Overview**
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages, providing structure and content. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree structure that represents the page content. Understanding the structure of web pages and the DOM is essential for locating and extracting data during web scraping.  When you pull up a web page in your browser, a request is sent to a web server and an HTML document is returned.  Your browser then parses that document and presents the page.  When you do web scraping, you'll also parse that page, not for presentation, but to capture information from that page so that it can be stored in a structured way.  You need to understand HTML and the DOM structure to do screen scraping.  Many of you may already be familiar with HTML -- if so, skip ahead.

### Elements of an HTML Document

Each element of the DOM has the following:
- A tag, the name for the type of element.
- Attributes.  These are name-value pairs, and vary with the element type.  For example, a `class` attribute might describe the display style for the element.  For a link element, the `href` attribute describes web address to use for the link.  There are many others.
- Content.  This may be text, or it may be other elements.  As the DOM is a tree, some elements contain others.

### **Key HTML Elements:**
- **`<title>`**: The title of the page.
- **`<p>`**: Paragraphs of text.
- **`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>`**: Headers of varying levels.
- **`<a>`**: Links with `href` attributes pointing to URLs.
- **`<img>`**: Images with `src` attributes indicating the image source.

There are many others.

### For Further Reference

A good online refernce to HTML is available at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/).

### **Hands-On Activity:**

1. Open the Wikipedia page for "Web Scraping" ([Wikipedia - Web Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)).
2. Open the developer tools for your browser.  For Chrome this is `Shift-Ctrl-J`.  Inspect the elements of the page.  In the Chrome developer tools, they are in the `Elements` tab. 
3. Traverse this collection of elements to:
   - Identify the title of the page.
   - Locate the first paragraph and examine its structure.
   - Explore headers (`<h1>, <h2>, <h3>`) and links (`<a>`).

When you are creating a web scraping program, this is often the first step.  Look at the page you want to scrape in the browser developer tools and find where the information you want resides within the DOM, so that you can write code to extract it.

### **How the DOM Is Structured:**
The DOM is a hierarchical tree structure. Here's an example:
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Web Scraping</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is an example paragraph.</p>
    <a href="https://example.com">Example Link</a>
  </body>
</html>
```

## **9.2 Web Scraping Tools: Selenium and WebDriver Manager**

### **Overview and Setup**

To scrape data from a web page, two primary libraries are commonly used in Python:
- **`Selenium`**: A library that executes the same actions as a web browser, and makes the resulting page available for subsequent operations.
- **`WebDriver Manager`**: Selenium requires a driver, which performs the actual web operations, just as a browser would.  This library makes the appropriate driver available to your program in an automated way.

You need to install these into your python_homework directory.  Within your VSCode terminal session for `python_homework` do:

```bash
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
```

### **Steps to Web Scraping:**
1. Initialize Selenium and the appropriate driver.  We'll use the Chromium driver, which is the same one as is in Chrome and other browsers.
2. Retrieve a web page.
3. Extract the desired elements using CSS selectors.

This is the initialization you'll need to do:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()))

```

Once you have a driver, you can fetch a web page, as follows:

```python
driver.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping")
```

### **Explanation: Why do we Need So Much Machinery?**

This may seem a pretty heavy collection of stuff just to scrape a web page.  However, most web pages these days are dynamic.  They contain JavaScript, and after the page loads, the scripts run to populate the page.  So, we need an engine that will not only get the page, but also run the JavaScript, and the JavaScript may itself make Ajax or Fetch calls to get more data.  A lot happens to create the appearance of the page you see.

Try the code above in your Python interative shell.  You'll see something a little odd.  A window will flash up with the actual page we are trying to scrape.  This can be interesting or annoying, depending on which side of the bed you got up on.  You can configure your driver to run in 'headless' mode, without a window, when you create the driver:

```python
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument('--headless')  # Enable headless mode
options.add_argument('--disable-gpu')  # Optional, recommended for Windows
options.add_argument('--window-size=1920x1080')  # Optional, set window size

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()),options=options)

```

### **Finding Information**

A web page is comprised of HTML elements.  You can find elements within the page, and the most flexible way to find them is by CSS selector.  If you have done web page styling, you have used CSS selectors to specify which elements should have a particular style: font, color, background color, border, etc.  Selectors have various criteria.  Here are some examples:

```
Select by element name:

'p' : select all paragraphs
'h2' : select all h2 headings

Select by element class:

'.this-style-class' : All elements that have a class of this-style-class.  The . means select by class

Select by attribute:

'[src]' : All elements that have a value for the src attribute, such as img elements.
'[data-event="meeting"]' : All elements that have a value for the data-event attribute equal to "meeting".

There are others.  There are also combined selectors:

'div.main-container' : All div elements that have a class of main-container.
```

CSS selectors can be as complicated as need be, but typically you do not want to do complicated selection when web scraping, as this will make your scraping program frail.  If you want a full tutorial on CSS selectors, go here: [https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp]

Here are some examples.  Try them out in your Python interative shell (assuming you have already loaded the web page into your driver as shown above):

```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

title = driver.title # Find the title.  Parts of the header are accessed directly, not via find_element(), which only works on the body
print(title)

body = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'body') # Find the first body element, typically only one
if body:
    links = body.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'a') # Find all the links in the body.
    if len(links) > 0:
        print("href: ", links[0].get_attribute('href'))  # getting the value of an attribute



main_div = body.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'div[id="mw-content-text"]')
if main_div:
    bolds = main_div.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'b')
    if len(bolds) > 0:
        print("bolds: ",bolds[0].text)

# Extract all images with their src attributes
images = [(img.get_attribute('src')) for img in body.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'img[src]')] # all img elements with a src attribute
print("Image Sources:", images)
# hmm, this example uses a list comprehension.  We haven't talked about those.  This is the same as:
image_entries = driver.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'img[src]')
images = []
for img in image_entries:
    images.append(img.get_attribute('src'))

print("Image Sources:", images)
# You can see that list comprehensions are a useful shortcut in Python!
```

Once you get an element, you can do the following (this is not an exhaustive list):

- Get the text value, if any.
- Get the value of any attributes.
- Search the descendants.

You can then close the browser connection with:

```python
driver.quit()
```

The `driver.get()` method can raise an exception.  It's a good idea to do it in a try block:

```python
try:
    driver.get("https://nonsense.never.com")
except Exception as e:
    print("couldn't get the web page")
    print(f"Exception: {type(e).__name__} {e}")
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

**Note:** Selenium is not used only for web scraping.  It can automate interaction with a browser page. One common use is to do end-to-end testing.  You can type into the fields of forms, you can click on submit buttons, you can refresh the page, you can hit the back button, and so on.  We won't do any of this for this lesson.

## **9.3 Ethical Web Scraping**

### **Overview**
While web scraping can be a powerful tool, it is important to follow ethical guidelines and respect website ownersâ€™ wishes to avoid excessive server load and legal issues.

### **Key Concepts:**
- **What is `robots.txt`?**
  - A file that specifies which sections of a website can or cannot be accessed by web crawlers.
- **Why is `robots.txt` important?**
  - It helps website owners control the traffic to their site and avoid server overload.
  - Ethical scraping involves reviewing and adhering to the rules set in `robots.txt`.

### **Activity: Explore `robots.txt` for Wikipedia**
1. Access the `robots.txt` file for Wikipedia: [Wikipedia Robots.txt](https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt).
2. Identify restricted sections of the site.
3. Discuss why these sections are restricted.

### **Example Code: Accessing `robots.txt`**
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
robots_url = "https://en.wikipedia.org/robots.txt"
driver.get(robots_url)
print(driver.page_source)
driver.quit()

```

## **9.4 XPath to Traverse the DOM**

### **Overview**
After scraping basic data, you can refine your scraping strategy to focus on specific sections of a webpage.  Sometimes, though, the find by CSS selector approach does not suffice.  Have a look at the [Wikipedia Web Scraping page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) Somewhere near the bottom, you see the `See also` section.  Suppose you want to scrape each of the links in that section.  You first open up the developer tools in your browser to see how you find the section.  Open up the elements tab and do a ctrl-f to find "See also".  The second hit gets you pretty close.  This is an `h2` element.  If you scroll down a little bit, you see a `div` further down in the page, and that div has the list of links you want.  But (sigh) there are no good identifiers like class or id or attribute to find this div.  So you go back to that h2 with "See also".  That h2 has the id of "See_also".  This helps some.  What you want to do is go up to the parent div, the one that contains that h2, call it parent_div.  Then you get the div that is the next div sibling of parent_div.  That's the one you want.

It is clear that finding by CSS selector won't work in this case.  You have to use another technique, called XPath.  There is an XPath tutorial [here.](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp) We won't need most of XPath, but we do need to know the XPath axes, specifically parent and sibling.  Here's the code:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=ChromeService(ChromeDriverManager().install()))
driver.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping")  # this much you've seen before

see_also_h2 = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR,'[id="See_also"]') # our starting point
links = []
if (see_also_h2):
    parent_div = see_also_h2.find_element(By.XPATH, '..') # up to the parent div
    if parent_div:
        see_also_div = parent_div.find_element(By.XPATH,'following-sibling::div' ) # over to the div with all the links
        link_elements = see_also_div.find_elements(By.CSS_SELECTOR, 'a')
        for link in link_elements:
            print(f"{link.text}: {link.get_attribute('href')}")
            name = link.text.strip()
            url = link.get_attribute("href")
            if name and url:
                links.append({"name": name, "url": url})


driver.quit()
```

### **Testing on Another Page:**

Test the script on different Wikipedia pages to ensure consistency and robustness.

## **9.5 Managing Requests and Handling Errors**

### **Overview**
When scraping large numbers of web pages, managing requests responsibly is essential. Techniques include delaying requests and handling connection errors.  

- The `driver.get()` operation may raise an exception. Sometimes this is a timeout.  Or perhaps the network might be down.  It may not help to retry the request in this case.
- The `driver.get()` operation may return an HTTP response code like 404 or 500.  Selenium does *not* raise an exception in this case.  Unfortunately, there is no easy way to access the HTTP response code in Selenium.  You can check if driver.title is the string you expect.
- You can do a subsequent driver.get() to scrape another page, but if you do, you want to pause between pages.  It is an abuse to drive excessive load by many rapid requests.
    ```python
    from time import sleep
    try:
        driver.get('https://acme.com/index.html')
        ... # extract data
        sleep(2) # wait 2 seconds
        driver.get('https://acme.com/another.html')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An exception occurred: {type(e).__name__} {e}")
    finally:
        driver.quit()

    ```

## **9.6 Saving Scraped Data**

### **Overview**
Once you've scraped valuable data, you may want to save it in a structured format, such as CSV or JSON.

### **Saving Data to CSV:**
```python
import csv

# Save extracted data to a CSV file
with open('scraped_data.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Link"])
    for link in links:
        writer.writerow([link["name"], link["url"]])
```

### **Saving Data to JSON:**
```python
import json

# Save data to a JSON file
data = {"links": links}
with open('scraped_data.json', 'w') as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file, indent=4)
```

### **Saving Data to an SQL Database**

Suppose you are scraping from multiple sites.  You may want to record different information from each site, and keep track of which site provided which information.  

For example, you may scrape airline sites for destinations, prices, and departure times.  You could create three tables, one for airlines, which would record the airline name and URL, and then three others for destinations, prices, and departure_times.  There would be a many-to-many relationship between airlines and destinations, which might have where_we_fly as a join table.  There would be a one-to-many relationship between where_we_fly entries and departure_times, and a one-to-many relationship between departure_times and prices (for economy, business, and first class). This is a little more complicated, to be sure -- but think about your data model when you get ready to store web scraping data!

## **9.7 Frailty in Web Scraping**

Web scraping programs can be frail.  The authors of the websites that you are accessing to scrape data can change the format of the page.  This can break the scraping logic, as the DOM may no longer be organized as you expect, or because the entries have different classes or ids.  Sometimes you can make your scraping more robust by finding known strings within the formatted page, and traversing from that point, but sometimes you can only log the error so as to trigger work on a fix.

## **Summary**

In this lesson, you learned:
1. How to understand the structure of web pages using HTML and the DOM.
2. How to use Python libraries `Selenium` and `WebDriver Manager` for web scraping.
3. Ethical considerations of web scraping, including respecting `robots.txt`.
4. Techniques for extracting specific data, handling errors, and managing requests.
5. How to save scraped data to CSV and JSON formats for future use.

### **Important Notes:**
