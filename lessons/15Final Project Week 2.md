# Lesson 15 — Final Project, Week 2

Congratulations — you've made it to the final week of the course! This week, your goals are:
1. **Finish and submit your final projects**.
2. **Record a short project presentation** to share with the rest of the class.

Please refer to the assignment section below and/or your Week 13 Lesson for Kaggle Project and Week 14 Lesson for your Local Scraping Project to review details and make sure your final projects meet requirements.  Also in the assignment section, you have detailed instructions on how to make and prepare a video of your demonstrated working projects to share with us.   Once you've completed your final projects and video, you'll submit all of these things with your usual Submit Assignment form that you've been using each week.  The form will have additional fields on it to allow you share your Local Scraping Project repo link, your Kaggle link, as well as some information that goes with your video link.  

What happens next?
Once you've submitted your finals and your video, your reviewer will check your work on your final projects and either declare them needing revisions or being successful, as they have with all your other assignments.  Watch you email for those results.  

To view your and your classmates' final project presentations, you can visit your class gallery here: [Jamaican Boa Python Essentails Class - Video Demo Gallery](https://airtable.com/appoSRJMlXH9KvE6w/shrqml5HWXby1FzEz/tblTvxLLUlqtgtfbq)

As always, reach out to a mentor if you need help this week. You're almost there!
