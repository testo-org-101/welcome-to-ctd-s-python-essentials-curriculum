# **Lesson 09 — Advanced SQL and Database Integration**

## **Lesson Overview**
**Learning objective:** Students will deepen their understanding of SQL by learning advanced techniques such as subqueries, complex `JOIN`s, aggregation with functions, and using `HAVING` for conditional filtering. This lesson also introduces performance optimization techniques, transactions, parameterized queries, window functions, and more.

**Topics:**
1. Subqueries: Embedding queries within other SQL statements for dynamic filtering or calculations.
2. Complex JOINs: Using INNER and LEFT JOINs across multiple related tables.
3. Aggregation Functions: Using `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()` with `GROUP BY`.
4. Aggregation with HAVING: Filtering grouped results using `HAVING` after aggregation.
5. Performance Optimization: Creating indexes to speed up frequent queries.
6. Transactions and Rollbacks: Ensuring consistency with `BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`.
7. Parameterized Queries: Preventing SQL injection using safe input handling with placeholders.
8. Window Functions: Applying `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, and `OVER()` for row-level analytics.
9. Date and Time Functions: Calculating durations and extracting date components using `JULIANDAY()` and related functions.
10. Python Integration: Writing and executing SQL queries within Python scripts using `sqlite3`.

## **8.1 Understanding Subqueries**

### **Overview**
Subqueries are nested SQL queries used to perform intermediate calculations or selections before the main query executes.

### **Key Concepts:**
- Use subqueries to fetch results dynamically within another query.
- Common use cases include finding maximum, minimum, or aggregated values.

### **Example:**
Find the highest-paid employee in each department using a subquery.
```sql
SELECT department_id, employee_id, salary
FROM Employees AS e
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM Employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
);
```

### **Implementation in Python:**
```python
# Example using SQLite
conn = sqlite3.connect("company.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query
query = """
SELECT department_id, employee_id, salary
FROM Employees AS e
WHERE salary = (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM Employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
);
"""
cursor.execute(query)
print(cursor.fetchall())

conn.close()
```

## **8.2 Complex JOINs**

### **Overview**
Complex `JOIN`s allow you to retrieve data from multiple related tables.

### **Steps:**
1. Create a `Projects` table and insert sample data.
2. Use a `JOIN` to combine employee and project information through the department field.

### **Key Concepts:**
- `INNER JOIN`: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN`: Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right.

### **SQL Example: Create and Populate a Projects Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Projects (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    department TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO Projects (name, department) VALUES
('Project A', 'HR'),
('Project B', 'IT'),
('Project C', 'Finance');
```

### **SQL Example: Complex JOIN**
List employees working in departments responsible for a specific project:
```sql
SELECT Employees.name, Projects.name AS project_name
FROM Employees
JOIN Projects ON Employees.department = Projects.department
WHERE Projects.name = 'Project A';
```

---

## **8.3 Aggregation**

### **Overview**
Aggregation functions like `MIN()`, `MAX()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` allow you to summarize data across groups.

### **Task:**
Calculate the minimum and maximum salaries and the number of employees in each department.

### **SQL Example:**
```sql
SELECT department_id, 
       MIN(salary) AS min_salary, 
       MAX(salary) AS max_salary, 
       COUNT(employee_id) AS num_employees
FROM Employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### **Key Notes:**
- Use `GROUP BY` to organize results by department.
- Ensure fields in the `SELECT` clause are either aggregated or part of the `GROUP BY`.

---

## **8.4 Aggregation with HAVING**

### **Overview**
The `HAVING` clause filters aggregated results after the `GROUP BY` operation.

### **Task:**
List all departments where the average salary exceeds 70,000 and display the department manager.

### **SQL Example:**
```sql
SELECT d.department_name, 
       d.manager_id, 
       AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Departments AS d
JOIN Employees AS e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_id
HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 70000;
```

### **Key Notes:**
- Use `HAVING` instead of `WHERE` to filter aggregated results.
- Combine `JOIN`s and `GROUP BY` for advanced aggregations.

## **8.5 Performance Optimization: Indexing**

### **Overview**
SQL queries can sometimes be slow if they involve large tables. Indexes can be created on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` clauses to speed up query performance.

### **SQL Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department ON Employees(department_id);
```

This creates an index on the `department_id` column to speed up queries that filter by department.

---

## **8.6 Transactions and Rollbacks**

### **Overview**
Transactions ensure that multiple database operations are completed successfully before committing them. If an error occurs, you can roll back the changes to keep the database in a consistent state.

### **Example:**
```python
# Start a transaction
conn = sqlite3.connect("company.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Employees (name, department_id) VALUES ('John Doe', 2)")
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO Employees (name, department_id) VALUES ('Jane Smith', 3)")
    conn.commit()  # Commit transaction
except Exception as e:
    conn.rollback()  # Rollback transaction if there's an error
    print("Error:", e)

conn.close()
```

---

## **8.7 Parameterized Queries to Prevent SQL Injection**

### **Overview**
SQL injection can be prevented by using parameterized queries, ensuring that user input is treated safely.

### **Example:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department_id = ?;", (department_id,))
```

This ensures that `department_id` is treated as a parameter and not part of the SQL statement itself.  If any part of the SQL statement comes from the end user or other untrusted source, always put that part in a parameter so that it can be sanitized to strip out rogue SQL.  Don't do it like this:

```python
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department_id = {department_id};")
# or, equally bad:
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE department_id = " + department_id + ";")
```

---

## **8.8 Window Functions**

### **Overview**
SQL window functions allow for advanced analysis over a specified range of rows. For example, calculating the rank of employees within a department based on salary.

### **SQL Example:**
```sql
SELECT name, salary, department_id,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM Employees;
```

---

## **8.9 Date and Time Functions**

### **Overview**
SQL provides functions for manipulating and querying date and time data, which are useful when working with time-based analysis.

### **SQL Example:**
```sql
SELECT name, date_of_birth, 
       JULIANDAY('now') - JULIANDAY(date_of_birth) AS age_in_days
FROM Employees;
```

---

## **8.10 Implementing All Techniques in Python**

### **Implementation Tips**

1. **Test Queries Separately:**
   - Write and test each query independently in your script or database interface before integrating into Python.

2. **Iterative Debugging:**
   - Verify intermediate outputs (e.g., after `JOIN` or subquery execution).

3. **Error Handling in Python:**
   - Use `try-except` blocks to handle database connection errors.

### **Example Python Script:**
```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect("company.db")
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Aggregation with HAVING
query = """
SELECT d.department_name, 
       d.manager_id, 
       AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
FROM Departments AS d
JOIN Employees AS e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_id
HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 70000;
"""

# Execute and fetch results
cursor.execute(query)
results = cursor.fetchall()
print(results)

conn.close()
```
