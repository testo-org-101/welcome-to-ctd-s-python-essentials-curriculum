# Lesson 14 â€” Web Scraping and Dashboard Project

## Lesson Overview
In this lesson, students will create **four programs** that retrieve baseball history data from the **Major League Baseball History** website and display the results in an interactive dashboard. The project will involve **Selenium** for web scraping, data cleaning, transforming the data into a structured format, storing it in a SQLite database, querying it via command line, and presenting it using **Streamlit** or **Dash** with interactive visualizations.

**Learning Objective:**  
By completing this project, students will:
- Use **Selenium** to scrape data from a website.
- Clean and transform the raw data into a structured format.
- Store the data in a SQLite database, with each CSV file as a separate table.
- Query the database using **joins** via command line.
- Build an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Dash** to display the insights.

**Projects:**
1. **Web Scraping Program**: Scrape data from the [Major League Baseball History](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearmenu.shtml) website, assemble it into DataFrames, and store the data as several CSV files.
2. **Database Import Program**: Import the CSV files into a **SQLite** database, with each CSV file as a separate table.
3. **Database Query Program**: Create a command-line program to query the database using **joins** (e.g., joining player statistics with event data).
4. **Dashboard Program**: Build a dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Dash** to visualize the data, allowing interactivity for users to explore the data.

All four programs will be included in the **GitHub** repository, and the dashboard will be deployed for public access.

## Data Sources

Students will scrape data from the **[Major League Baseball History Site](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearmenu.shtml)**, which includes historical baseball data such as notable events, player statistics, and achievements year by year.
