### üéôÔ∏è Podcast: Lesson 1

We‚Äôre excited to introduce a new optional resource to support your learning‚Äî**short, mentor-style podcast episodes that break down key assignments and concepts in a friendly, approachable way.**

If you ever feel stuck, want a quick refresher before diving in, or just prefer listening over reading, these episodes are here to help! They‚Äôll cover **how to approach your assignment, common tricky spots, and why these skills matter‚Äîall in a quick, easy-to-digest format**.

**These podcasts are generated by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)** ‚Äî a new tool we're still exploring. Let us know if these are helpful, and happy coding!

**[Listen to the assignment overview podcast here](https://youtu.be/azM0-ybstt4).**

Since the podcast was created, the assignment itself has been updated to make it more comprehensive, so the podcast doesn't match up. You could check out the format/style of the podcast to see if it is the sort of thing that would help you.

## **Instructions**

### **Setup**

Your homework for this and some future assignments will use a special python homework repository, so that it can be submitted using git.  That repository is [here.](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/python_homework)  Click on the link, and carefully **follow the instructions in the README**.  You will then have your own copy of the repository, connected to your GitHub account.  You create the program files for the homework in the root of that repository.  For each assignment, you create a separate git branch (e.g. `git checkout -b lesson1`).  When you have completed your assignment, you add and commit your changes in that branch, push it to your GitHub, and create a pull request for that branch from your lesson branch (as the compare) to main branch (as the base).  You provide a link to that pull request when you submit your homework.  Your instructor will review it, approving or requesting changes.  Once your instructor has approved the pull request, you can merge it so that your lesson work gets updated to the main branch.  The reason for this workflow is to mimic what's done in the industry of making features and fixes on separate branches before testing/checking it.  Once the code is tested and checked by a supervisor/review process, the code gets merged to a production branch (in this case your main branch) so the users will see updates.

### **Step 1: Complete the Coding Tasks**  

At the outset, you create python `.py` files.  In some future lessons, you will create Jupyter notebooks. Homework for this assignment is created within your `python_homework` folder.  Be sure to create an `assignment1` git branch.  Then, write Python code to complete the following tasks.  As you do, put in **comment lines to mark your code for Task 1, Task 2, and so on.** That will help your reviewer.

This assignment uses a Python tool for automated testing, called PyTest.  You installed it when you set up the python_homework folder.  You'll code a series of functions.  PyTest will validate whether your code is correct.  To run the test:  

- Change to the python_homework/assignment1 folder.
- Type `code .` to bring up VSCode for this folder. 
- Start a git bash terminal session within VSCode and enter the command (you can make git bash the default using ctl-shift-p and setting the `Terminal: Select Default Profile`)

```bash
pytest -v -x assignment1-test.py # can use just -x, adding -v lists the passing tests
```

PyTest attempts to perform the tests, and as you haven't written the code yet, it quickly ends with an error -- in this case, because you haven't created the hello function.  You follow this pattern: 

- Add your code to the `./assignment1/assignment1.py file` which is provided (but it's empty.)
- Write each function according to the instructions below.
- Put a print() statement in the mainline of your code (not inside the function), and call the function from within the print() statement to see if it works.  You can run the file by typing `python assignment1.py`.
- Then run the test using the command above.  
- If it reports errors, change your code to fix them.  

Once the first test passes, you'll get an error for the second test, so you go on to write the second function, and so on until all 10 tests complete successfully.  You should have a look at assignment1-test.py to see how it works and what it tests for.  Keep going until all tests pass.

There are a number of new Python capabilities introduced during this assignment, beyond what is in the lesson, but they are explained below, so that you can learn and practice at the same time.

**Help is Available**

We have covered quite a bit.  If you get stuck, 1:1 mentors are available to answer your questions.  Appointments are available in the [1:1 Mentor Table](https://airtable.com/appoSRJMlXH9KvE6w/shrQinGb1phZYwdiL)

---

### **Task 1: Hello**

Write a hello function that takes no arguments and returns `Hello!`.  Now, what matters here is what the function *returns*.  You can print() whatever you want for debugging purposes, but the tests ignore that, and only check the return value.

### **Task 2: Greet with a Formatted String**

Write a greet function.  It takes one argument, a name, and returns `Hello, Name!`.  Use a formatted string.  Note that you have to return exactly the right string or the test fails -- but PyTest tells you what didn't match.

### **Task 3: Calculator**  
- Write a calc function.  It takes three arguments.  The default value for the third argument is "multiply".  The first two arguments are values that are to be combined using the operation requested by the third argument, a string that is one of the following add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulo, int_divide (for integer division) and power.  The function returns the result.
- Error handling: When the function is called, it could ask you to divide by 0. That will throw an exception: Which one?  You can find out by triggering the exception in your program or in the Python Interactive Shell.  Wrap the code within the calc function in a try block, and put in an except statement for this exception.  If the exception occurs, return the string "You can't divide by 0!".  
- More error handling: When the function is called, the parameters that are passed might not work for the operation.  For example, you can't multiply two strings.  Find out which exception occurs, catch it, and return the string "You can't multiply those values!".
- Here's a tip.  You have to do different things for add, multiply, divide and so on.  So you can do a conditional cascade, if/elif/elif/else.  That's perfectly valid.  But you might want to use the match-case Python statement instead.  Look it up!  It just improves code appearance.

Again, as you complete each function, you run the test to see whether everything is correct.

---

### **Task 4: Data Type Conversion** 
- Create a function called data_type_conversion.  It takes two parameters, the value and the name of the data type requested, one of float, str, or int.  Return the converted value.
- Error handling: The function might be called with a bad parameter.  For example, the caller might try to convert the string "nonsense" to a float.  Catch the error that occurs in this case.  If this error occurs, return the string `You can't convert {value} into a {type}.`, except you use the value and data type that are passed as parameters -- so again you use a formatted string.

---

### **Task 5: Grading System, Using `*args`** 
- Create a grade function.  It should collect an arbitrary number of parameters, compute the average, and return the grade.
based on the following scale:  
   - A: 90 and above  
   - B: 80-89  
   - C: 70-79  
   - D: 60-69  
   - F: Below 60  
- When you use `*args` you get access to a variable named `args` in your function, which is a tuple, an ordered collection of values like a list.  You'll learn more about tuples and lists in the next lesson.  There are some helpful functions you can use at this point: `sum(args)`, `len(args)`, and so on.  One of the curiosities of Python is that these are not methods of any class.  They are just standalone functions.
- Handle the error that occurs if the parameters are nonsense.  Return the string "Invalid data was provided." in this case.  (Typically, you don't handle every possible exception in your error handling, except if the values in the parameters comes from the end user.)

---

### **Task 6: Use a For Loop with a Range**  
- Create a function called repeat.  It takes two parameters, a string and a count, and returns a new string that is the old one repeated count times.
- You can get the test to pass by just returning `string * count`.  That would produce the correct return value.  But, for this task, do it using a for loop and a range.

---

### **Task 7: Student Scores, Using `**kwargs`**  

- Create a function called student_scores.  It takes one positional parameter and an arbitrary number of keyword parameters.  The positional parameter is either "best" or "mean".  If it is "best", the name of the student with the higest score is returned.  If it is "mean", the average score is returned.
- As you are using `**kwargs`, your function can access a variable named `kwargs`, which is a dict.  The next lesson explains about dicts.  What you need to know now is the following:
   - A dict is a collection of key value pairs.
   - You can iterate through the dict as follows:
   ```python
   for key, value in kwargs.items():
   ```
   - You can also get `kwargs.keys()` and `kwargs.values()`.
- The arbitrary list of keyword arguments uses the names of students as the keywords and their test score as the value for each.

---

### **Task 8: Titleize, with String and List Operations**

- Create a function called titleize.  It accepts one parameter, a string.  The function returns a new string, where the parameter string is capitalized as if it were a book title.
- The rules for title capitalization are: (1) The first word is always capitalized. (2) The last word is always capitalized. (3) All the other words are capitalized, except little words.  For the purposes of this task, the little words are "a", "on", "an", "the", "of", "and", "is", and "in".
- The following string methods may be helpful: split(), join(), and capitalize().  Look 'em up.
- The split() method returns a list. You might store this in the `words` variable.  `words[-1]` gives the last element in the list.
- The `in` comparison operator: You have seen `in` used in loops.  But it can also be used for comparisons, for example to check to see if a substring occurs in a string, or a value occurs in a list.
- A new trick: As you loop through the words in the `words` list, it is helpful to have the index of the word for each iteration.  You can access that index using the enumerate() function:
```python
for i, word in enumerate(words):
```

---

### **Task 9: Hangman, with more String Operations**

- Create a function hangman.  It takes two parameters, both strings, the secret and the guess.
- The secret is some word that the caller doesn't know.  So the caller guesses various letters, which are the ones in the guess string.
- A string is returned.  Each letter in the returned string corresponds to a letter in the secret, except any letters that are not in the guess string are replaced with an underscore.  The others are returned in place.  Not everyone has played this kid's game, but it's common in the US.
- Example: Suppose the secret is "alphabet" and the guess is "ab".  The returned string would be "a___ab__".
- Note that Python strings are immutable.  That means that the following code would give an error:
```python
secret = "alphabet"
secret[1] = "_"
```
- On the other hand, you can concatenate strings with the `+` operator.

---

### **Task 10: Pig Latin, Another String Manipulation Exercise**

- Pig Latin is a kid's trick language.  Each word is modified according to the following rules.  (1) If the string starts with a vowel (aeiou), "ay" is tacked onto the end. (2) If the string starts with one or several consonants, they are moved to the end and "ay" is tacked on after them. (3) "qu" is a special case, as both of them get moved to the end of the word, as if they were one consonant letter.
- Create a function called pig_latin.  It takes an English string or sentence and converts it to Pig Latin, returning the result.  We will assume that there is no punctuation and that everything is lower case.
